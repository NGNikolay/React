 1) TIC-TAC-TOE game. This is a project that helped me to start thinking like React developer. I've tryed to use as little state as possible while deriving as much info from it.

 <span>Here you can check the game: https://gnikolay-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app</span>
 
 <span> * there are some improvements that I may add for mobile in the future</span>
 <span> Just transitioned the game in Typescript</span>
